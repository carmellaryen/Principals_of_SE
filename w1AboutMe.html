    <div>My name is CarmellaRyen Macababbad.  I am a Military Intelligence Equipment and Systems Maintainer/Integrator for the US Army. I have been in the Army for almost 8 years.  I love technology and am a total gadget geek.  I am currently studying Computer Science at a local university.  I find it interesting and challenging.  It constantly keeps me on my toes trying to learn the next "new" thing.  At least, its new to me anyway :)</div><br>
